# Web_Programming
Web Programming final project. Front-end &amp; Back-end  

-This is a project my partner & I created for the web programming course, where I developed the back-end, and my partner developed the front-end and came up with the idea  

-We developed a train ticket booking web application which allows users to book train tickets and shows them the details of the ticket after they have booked it for them to save and print. The purpose of this project was to develop a fully functioning web application that saves data into the databse and retrieves data from the database and displays it onto the screen. We used MongoDB for the database, Express to link the back-end to the front-end, and NodeJS to setup the server and the database. We hosted the web application locally  

-We developed this project using the MEAN stack, although we did not implement AngularJS in this project since we did not study it, and we were short on time to self learn as we completed this project in 2 days
